# LC_TODO

Without loss of PFuzz capabilities, current assumptions about the user input program, which can be relaxed in the future:

* If applicable, add a tail table to avoid the dummy tbl_act, which may be auto-generated by Tofino compiler if there is a single block of conditional block
* Make NoAction explicit: make sure each table has an explicit default_action to avoid additional NoAction in context.json, which may trigger instrumentation plan to actions not present currently
* Absent of table predication logic
