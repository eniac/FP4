# LC_TODO

Without loss of PFuzz capabilities, current assumptions about the user input program, which can be relaxed in the future:

1. Absence of table predication logic
2. If applicable, add a tail table to avoid the dummy tbl_act, which may be auto-generated by Tofino compiler if there is a single block of conditional block --> relaxed, just ignore tbl_act node during path encoding, and PANIC if tbl_act is not the leaf (except EXIT)
3. Make default_action explicit: make sure each table has an explicit default_action to avoid additional NoAction in context.json, which would trigger instrumentation plan to actions not present in the source program. Note that simply ignoring NoAction will result in incorrect path encoding
4. Minor: for the ease of retrospection, it is better to use `if... else...` (which is fully equivalent) more explicitly to indicate the nested conditionals rather than `else if`.
5. Minor: currently, the naming of the tables and conditionals may affect the BL instrumentation plan (not for correctness).
6. Minor: in some edge cases, the generated ILP partition may not result in a weakly connected sub-DAG, i.e., there are isolated nodes. -> Fixed with an improved dummy edge instrumentation
